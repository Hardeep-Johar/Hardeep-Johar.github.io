            <h2>Course objectives</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this class is to give you a working knowledge
                of how to write computer programs, to get data from the web,
                and to build your own web applications. We'll learn the basic
                elements of programming through the language Python.
                At the end of this class, you can expect to be fairly proficient
                in using Python to build applications, understand enough about
                programming to be able to quickly pick up other languages
                (particularly scripting languages such as JavaScript, Ruby or Perl),
                and have a good understanding of what it takes to plan, analyze,
                design, implement and support software applications. We'll tour
                Python libraries for data analysis and, finally, we’ll put all
                these components together to learn how to crawl the web for data and
                to build web apps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your reward, at the end of the course (assuming you do
                everything seriously!) will be substantial. You’ll understand
                how computer applications  - large scale ones or small scale
                ones - work and you’ll be able to build working prototypes
                to illustrate and market your own ideas. But, be aware that
                this is an intensive course that will require a lot of work
                and a substantial time commitment.

               </li>
                <li>That I will answer every question (email, nyu classes,
                    in class, office hours) in a timely fashion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That I will be there for you to help you take your

                </li>
                <li>
                    That you don’t hesitate to ask for help from
                    me or from the Teaching Assistant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That you understand that this is a difficult
                    class and that the demands on your time will likely
                    be more than that in your other classes.

                </li>
                <li>
                    That, above all, you remember that the goal is to
                    learn and to enjoy the process of learning.

            <h2>Scope of the course</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Python and Django</b>. Designed (by Guido van Rossum)
                to be simple, readable, and uncomplicated, Python is about
                as intuitive as a programming language can get. Django is a
                web-framework, software that is designed to make the development
                and maintenance of a website as painless as possible. Django is
                written in Python for Python and runs on most web servers.
                With Python and Django you can prototype your web app ‘off-server’
                and then,
                once you’ve tested it, easily port it to a web server.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Python2 vs. Python3</b>. Unfortunately, there are two
                versions of Python and they aren't fully compatible. We'll be
                using Python3 (current version: 3.4.2) mainly because
                Python2 is slated to go away (though, in the open source world,
                that doesn't mean a whole lot!)
                but also because it is a better language.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>. HTML is a markup language.
                Pieces of text are ‘tagged’ (bold, headings, list elements,
                buttons, forms) and these tags are interpreted by the
                browser when it renders a web page. CSS is a style sheet
                language that integrates with HTML to create a common 'look and
                feel’ for a website (CSS is what gives all Stern pages
                the same look). JavaScript is a programming language
                much used on websites (because client computers can run
                javascript programs). We won’t have the time to cover
                JavaScript but you will have the tools and knowledge to
                pick it up quickly if necessary.

    <a name="grading">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Evaluation and learning components</h2>
            <p>
            <b>Mini Quizzes</b>: We’ll have several, very short, quizzes
                mainly to reinforce points made in class and also to
                help you get your hands dirty. Most quizzes will be
                online 'do whenever you have the time', though some may
                be in-class. All quizzes are open book and you're welcome to
                check your solutions on your computers. Quizzes will be lightly
                graded so make a good faith effort and you’ll do fine.
                One or two quiz scores will be dropped in computing your
                quiz grade so no worries if you mess one up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home assignments</b>: We’ll have a few home assignments as
                well. Like the
                quizzes, assignments are not meant to be
                diagnostic but rather to help you practice and learn so
                they will be very (very!) lightly graded. You can consult
                with others, ask me questions, use google for help, but do
                try them on your own first.  Because I’ll either discuss
                the solution in class or put it up on the course site,
                late submissions will not be accepted (sorry!).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Project</b>: There is no better way to learn something than
                to go out and use it so start thinking about a web application
                that you think you’d like to build. The expectation is that
                you use the material we’ll cover in this class to plan,
                design, and implement a small web application. Your project
                grade will depend on how well your work illustrates your
                understanding of the course material. Final submission will
                include a design report, Python code, and an in-class
                "speed-date" presentation and demonstration.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Participation</b>: Demonstrate engagement in the course by
                asking questions. Preferably in the “Forums” section of the
                class website on NYU Classes. I'll respond to every question,
                either online or, if the response is of general interest, in
                the classroom.  Some classes have mandatory attendance (I'll
                let you know which ones).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Exam</b>: The course has one in-class exam toward the end
                of the semester. The exam will be a short “in-class” closed book,
                and closed computer exam though you are welcome to bring in a one
                page cheat sheet.

    <a name="computers">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Computers and the class</h2>
            <p>
                Computers are a requirement for this course and you are
                expected to bring one for every class. We'll do a lot of
                programming - the best way to learn is to see something in
                action and Python is an especially good language for making
                things happen. Make sure that your laptops have sufficient
                charge for the duration of the class!
            </p>
            <p>

                <b>Mac vs Windows</b>: Either is fine but, if you have the
                choice, then please use a Mac. It is much easier to install
                needed libraries on a Mac than it is on a Windows machine. In
                particular, if you have a Mac and are using some sort of
                Windows emulator then please use Mac OS-X and not the
                Windows emulator for the work you do in this class. The
                double redirection will make everything a lot slower. But,
                either Mac or Windows will work so don’t worry if you’re a
                Windows user.

            <h2>Texts</h2>
            <p>
               There is no required text for this class because,
                unfortunately, most books are designed for people who want
                to become computer programmers. However, I strongly suggest
                that you purchase the Mark Lutz book below so that you have
                something to read and work with outside the class. In the class,
                our focus is on usability and therefore we’ll use a mix of
                online resources, class slides and notes, and sample programs as
                a substitute for formal texts. The internet is an almost endless
                resource with excellent tutorials on almost everything and
                answers to practically every question you might have and I’ll
                point you to these resources as we move along the course.
